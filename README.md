# CTX-Liveview-in-LivePortal
The LiveView dashboard available through LivePortal

This repository allows the Liveview statistics that are available in Cortex Gateway to be displayed in Cortex LivePortal.
It is a single view combining the Summary view and the OCI performance dashboards.
The advantage of showing this in Cortex LivePortal is that more users that are no flow designers, can see the statistics and more granular access can be applied.

## Operation
This process works as such that the Dashboard UI is created in the background. This is an enhancement to the performance, when the flows start the dashboard is immediately available, the user doesn't have to wait on the data collection process.

## Related objects
This repository uses some subtasks part of the Material Design repository.
All related subtasks are included in the export package.

# Installation Instructions
